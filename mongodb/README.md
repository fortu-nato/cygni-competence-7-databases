# Mongo

##Before
Build and run our docker image. Beside mongodb (3.4.2) it has some of extra code for exercises:

    docker build -t cygni/mongo .
    docker run --name my-mongo -d cygni/mongo
   
We can now use the mongo shell within the container:
  
    docker exec -it my-mongo mongo
    
##CRUD
    
Change database:

    use mydb

###Create
Insert a document (and creates the collection `towns`):

    db.towns.insert({
        name: "New York",
        population: 22200000,
        last_census: ISODate("2009-07-31"),
        famous_for: ["statue-of-liberty", "food"],
        mayor: {
            name: "Michael Bloomberg",
            party: "I"
        }
    })
    
you can also insert several at once:

    db.towns.insert([
        {
            name: "Punxsutawney",
            population: 6200, 
            last_census: ISODate("2008-01-31"),
            famous_for: ["phil the groundhog"],
            mayor: { name : "Jim Wehrle" }
        },
        {
            name: "Portland", 
            population: 582000, 
            last_census: ISODate("2007-09-20"),
            famous_for: ["beer", "food"],
            mayor:  { name : "Sam Adams", party : "D" }
        }
    ])
    
###Read

Query all:
    
    db.towns.find()
    
The general form is:

    db.collection.find(query, projection)
   
where `query` filters documents and projection extracts fields from them.
An exact match on a field, the whole document:
    
    db.towns.find(
        {
            name: "New York"
        }
    )
    
the same result but extract only _id, name and population:

    db.towns.find(
        {
            name: "New York"
        },
        {
            name: 1,
            population: 1
        }
    )

the same without _id:

    db.towns.find(
        {
            name: "New York"
        },
        {
            _id: 0,
            name: 1,
            population: 1
        }
    )
    
Filter on subdocuments:
    
    db.towns.find(
        {
            "mayor.party" : "I"
        }
    )
        
filter with regexp:

    db.towns.find(
        {
            "mayor.name": /^.{3}\s/
        }
    )


Exercise (1.3): Find towns whose names contain an e and are famous for food or beer.

###Update

Update a field in a document:

    db.towns.update(
        {
            name: /new/i
        },
        { $set : { state: "NY" } }
    )

The general form is:
    
    db.collection.update(query, update, options)
      
where query filters just like in `find()` and update consists of a document which replaces the matched document or of update operators like `$set`. 
Works by default on single documents, options can be set to allow multiple updates but then the update must be done with operators.

Replace the complete town of New York with a document `{state : "New York""}`:
    
    db.towns.update(
        {
            name: /new/i
        },
        { state: "NY" }
    )

Exercise (1.4): Create a new database named blogger with a collection named articlesâ€”insert a new article with an author name and email, creation date, and text.
Exercise (1.5): Update the article with an array of comments, containing a comment with an author and text.
Exercise: Update the article by adding a comment to the array of comments.

###Delete

Just like querying:
    
    db.collection.remove(query, options)
    
The `query` is as in `find()`.

Delete democrats: 
    
    db.towns.remove(
        {
            "mayor.party": "D"
        }
    )
    
Wipe'em all:
    
    db.towns.remove({})
